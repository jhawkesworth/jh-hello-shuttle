    Hello.  Welcome to the least user-friendly temperature convertor on the web.
<p>
    GET https://jh-hello-shuttle.shuttleapp.rs/ftoc/[farenheit] - returns temperature in Celsius
<p>
    GET https://jh-hello-shuttle.shuttleapp.rs/ctof/[celsuis] - returns temperature in Farenheit
<p>
    Now with a different api and added support for converting kelvin!
<p>
    GET https://jh-hello-shuttle.shuttleapp.rs/[from]/[to]/[from_value]
<p>
    where [from] and [to] must be exactly one of 'celsius', 'farenheit' or 'kelvin'
    (or 'c', 'f', 'k' if you don't like typing)<p>
    and [from_value] is the known temperature (can include decimal point)
<p>
    Example:
<p>
    <a href="https://jh-hello-shuttle.shuttleapp.rs/farenheit/celsius/451">https://jh-hello-shuttle.shuttleapp.rs/farenheit/celsius/451</a>
<p>
    And finally it will refuse if you ask it to convert a temperature that is below absolute zero.
<p>
    Use at your own risk.  Enjoy!

    Totally unrelated to the above, if you are looking for the loot game from Herb Wolverson's most excellent book, Hands On Rust, its here.

    Buy the book its well worth it.  It is really only here as a demo of serving up some wasm from a rocket-based shuttle app.
